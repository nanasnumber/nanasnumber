## Footnote
*<sup>(1)</sup> Career Transition*

In my younger years, upon graduation from Chang Jung University in Taiwan, my primary working experiences were focused on audio production as I was a music enthusiast and was offered an opportunity in the field. I occasionally made use of my electrical engineering background to write up a scripts to process large batches of audio for the deliverable files, formats, etc.

I left Taiwan in 2012 after my wife gave birth to our son and we had made a mutual decision to raise our children in her home country, Quebec, Canada.

There was a period of time during the transition from Taiwan to Canada where I had to wait for my immigration paperwork, and so became a stay-at-home dad, taking care of my child while my wife returned to work.

Not only did this period of time allow me to reflect upon the direction that my career was going to take but also gave me a wonderful opportunity to study and explore my programming knowledge.

Because of my electrical engineering background, acquiring and understanding the knowledge came quickly as all the fundamental logics are transferable. Despite the fact that I did not major in CS during university, my strong fundamental logic, ability to ask the right questions, and resourcefulness allowed me to begin the journey in freelance web development projects, eventually landing fulltime work in the field.
