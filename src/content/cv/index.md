## Footnote
*<sup>(1)</sup> Career Transition*

<small>
In my early career, following my graduation from Chang Jung University in Taiwan, my professional focus centered on audio production, driven by my passion for music. Leveraging my background in electrical engineering, I adeptly developed scripts to efficiently process large volumes of audio, ensuring the delivery of high-quality files in various formats. In 2012, a significant life event led me to relocate to Quebec, Canada, with my family, prompting a transitional period during which I assumed the role of a stay-at-home dad while awaiting immigration paperwork. This interval provided me with the invaluable opportunity to reflect on my career trajectory and delve into the realm of programming. Given my foundation in electrical engineering, acquiring and comprehending programming knowledge became a swift process, as the fundamental logics were readily transferable. My robust logical reasoning, adept question-asking ability, and resourcefulness paved the way for my initiation into freelance web development projects. Subsequently, my proficiency and dedication culminated in securing full-time employment in the field, marking a pivotal step in my professional journey.
