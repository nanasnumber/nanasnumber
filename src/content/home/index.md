# Shawn Yisiou Wu

Software Developer, Husband, Father, Skateboarder, Beatmaker, Record Collector

Hey there! I'm Shawn Yisiou Wu, but you can call me Shawn, Isho, Krozz, or even find me online as nanasnumber (a quirky JavaScript NaN joke). Outside of the tech world, I'm a husband, dad to two energetic boys, and you might catch me skateboarding, making beats, or digging for dusty vinyl records in thrift stores. With a solid background in software development, especially front-end, I've been on this exciting journey since my recording studio days writing scripts for organizing large batches of audio files for music production. Beyond just programming, I love diving into the unknown, bringing a hacker mindset to problem-solving. Whether collaborating effectively with diverse teams or helping clients from various domains, I see my role not just as a programmer but as someone here to address business challenges through a technical lens. Let's connect, explore, and make something together!
