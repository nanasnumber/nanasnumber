# Shawn Yisiou Wu
**Software Developer, Programmer, Husband, Father, Skateboarder, Beatmaker, Record Collector**

Hey there! I'm **Shawn Yisiou Wu**, but you can call me Shawn, Isho, Krozz, or even find me online as nanasnumber (a quirky JavaScript NaN joke). Outside of the tech world, I'm a husband, dad to two energetic boys, and you might catch me skateboarding, making beats, or digging dusty vinyl record in thrift store. With a solid background in software development, especially front-end, I've been on this exciting journey since my recording studio days writing script orgnizing large batch of audio files. Beyond just programming, I love diving into the unknown, bringing a hacker mindset to problem-solving. Whether collaborating with different teams or helping clients from various domains, I see my role not just as a programmer but as someone here to tackle business problems from a technical perspective. Let's connect, explore, and make something together!
